      <h1>First Day Back After Track-Out</h1>
      <p class="post-meta">November 13, 2025 · 4–5 min read</p>

      <p>Last night I watched <em>Young Sheldon</em> with my parents, then went to sleep knowing I had school the next morning. When my alarm went off at 7:00 AM, I got up, brushed my teeth, took a bath, and ate breakfast before my dad drove me to school.</p>

      <p>As soon as I arrived, I saw the school resource officer and the 6th-grade assistant principal greeting everyone at the entrance. Because of my schedule, my first class in 8th grade is P.E., so I headed straight to the gym. Walking in and seeing all my friends from different tracks was honestly the best part of the morning. We talked for a bit, went to the locker room, and then spent about 45 minutes playing a new gym game before heading out.</p>

      <p>Next was Spanish. My teacher greeted me and, as usual, asked everyone a question before letting us enter the classroom. We didn’t do much in that class today — mainly catching up and getting ready for the next unit.</p>

      <p>After that came my first core class: ELA. Everyone says this class is the “weak link,” but I honestly don’t mind it or the teacher. Then came Science… my least favorite subject. It’s way too early in the day for the kind of stuff we have to do, and it gets repetitive. Once that was done, we finally had team time, which is basically a quick 15-minute recess break.</p>

      <p>Lunch was the most shocking part of the day. Track 4 and 1 took all the good tables on the sides and the middle tables, and we were left with only two tables and three plastic extras outside the cafeteria. Some students literally had to sit on the floor. It was honestly pretty gross.</p>

      <p>After lunch we had Spartan Time — basically 30 minutes of work time — and then Social Studies. That’s my second favorite subject but my favorite <em>class</em>, mostly because of the teacher and what we’re learning. I thought it would be harder this year, but I realized that if you just pay attention and listen, you’ll ace the class (and honestly all of them).</p>

      <p>Finally came Math, my favorite subject but my second favorite class. I love math, and my teacher is pretty good too, but most of my friends are in this class, so sometimes it’s tough to stay focused unless I’m locked in. Still, they’re smart and help me learn too, so it balances out.</p>

      <p>When the bell rang, I waited with two friends for my bus to be called. I thought I was going to miss it because so many people kept passing by and my bus was at the very back of the line. We got on eventually and rushed to find seats. I talked to each of my friends until they got off, and then I helped guide the bus driver since she was filling in for our usual one.</p>

      <p>I walked home with my neighborhood friend who recently transferred to my school. When I got home, I didn’t have much homework. I ate, watched a little bit of TV, finished my work quickly, and then ran a quick mile on the treadmill.</p>

      <p>The coolest part of the day was testing our new super high-tech computer. My dad told me to try out some heavy graphic games, and I did — it was pretty sick. After that, I ate dinner while watching more <em>Young Sheldon</em>, then came upstairs to write this blog.</p>
