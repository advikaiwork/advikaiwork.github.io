      <h1>⚽ Training Day at Pleasant Park</h1>
      <p class="post-meta">October 30, 2025 · 3 min read</p>

      <p>Practice at Pleasant Park felt pretty normal today — nothing out of the ordinary, just another solid session. We had 16 players, including two guest players from the Challenge level, who were training up with us. It didn’t really change the vibe much, but it was cool to see how they handled the pace and tried to fit into the group.</p>

      <p>We spent most of the time scrimmaging, which is always my favorite part. Using the big goals made it feel more like a real match — longer runs, more space to play, and better chances to take shots. The tempo stayed high, and everyone was getting good touches on the ball.</p>

      <p>I felt pretty locked in today — the kind of practice where everything just clicks. My passes were clean, the ball control felt smooth, and I was moving into the right spots without overthinking. I wouldn’t say it was anything crazy, but yeah — I was definitely cooking a little out there.</p>

      <p>Overall, it was one of those practices that just felt solid. Nothing dramatic, no crazy moments — just good soccer, good energy, and everyone putting in work. Sometimes those are the best sessions — the quiet ones where you leave the field knowing you got better.</p>
